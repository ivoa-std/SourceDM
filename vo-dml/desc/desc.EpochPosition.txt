This class (fig \ref{fig:EpochPosition}) is a view of \texttt{Astronomical Coordinates and Coordinate Systems}
 \citep{2022ivoa.specQ1004R} components that have been combined to form a consistent description of 
the position of an object moving in time. 

It consists of a celestial position, a proper motion, a radial velocity and a parallax. 

All components use the same coordinate systems for both time and space coordinates.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Both position and proper motion reuse \texttt{coords:LonLatPoint} elements.
   \item The space coordinate system is imported from \texttt{coords:spaceSys}.
   \item The time coordinate system is imported from \texttt{coords:timeSys}.
\end{itemize}


All components have their own units which must be consistent with each other. 
This consistency is not enforced by the model.

Possible correlations between \texttt{EpochPosition} parameters are handled by the \texttt{EpochPositionCorrelations} class.
Errors along the different axes are grouped in the \texttt{EpochPositionErrors} class.

In some cases the errors might conflict with the correlations:

\begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{Ellipse} errors on position or proper motion must not be used together with the 
         \texttt{longitudeLatitude} (or \texttt{pmLongitudePmLatitude}) correlation fields.
         In fact, using elliptical errors implies a correlation between the two spatial axes which must not conflict
         with the correlations defined in \texttt{EpochPositionCorrelations}.
\end{itemize}
