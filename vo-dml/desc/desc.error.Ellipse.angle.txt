In theory, this is the angle between the North Polar Cape (NPC) and the major axis. 
This angle must be positive taking into account that angles are positive from North to the East. 
The angle has its own unit.
In practice, the angle definition is this used by the mapped data set. 
It is usually the angle between the major axis and the north axis (negative along of the clockwise direction).
